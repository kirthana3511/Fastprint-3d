# fast print: chaos log

total hours 40

yo. this is the behind-the-scenes mess for Fast Print  
before anything even prints, had to do brain gymnastics  
aka fake engineer mode. here’s what went down (it’s unhinged)

---

**june 15**  
4 hrs ?? just sketching stuff that looked cool but made zero sense  
thought i was designing a mars rover lol it’s literally a square with motors  
made a folder called “cool printer stuff” cuz vibes

---

**june 16**  
6 hrs in fusion 360. modeling the frame.  
constraints broke. brain broke. everything broke.  
dimensioned the steel frame tho.  
looked at it and whispered “i am inevitable” or some dumb marvel line

**june 17**  
2 hrs deep diving on linear rails. too many brands. too much stress  
THK? HIWIN? wish.com clone? who even knows anymore  
reddit said don’t trust clones. i now don’t trust reddit either

---

**june 18**  
5 hrs straight lost on shopee and random sketchy sites  
40 tabs open. most were fans. fans for hotends. fans for fans.  
accidentally almost bought an aquarium filter  
started BOM but it’s like... 10% done max

**june 19**  
3 hrs measuring steel tubes with a calculator that kept dying  
checked if local shops had good sizes  
also browsed aluminum profiles knowing i have 0 aluminum budget  
final measurements were oddly satisfying

---

**june 20**  
6 hrs in firmware jail. marlin vs klipper vs reprap  
klipper seems cool but also looks like it’ll kill my sleep schedule  
watched 3 vids at 2am. absorbed 0% info  
note to self: firmware is fake and made up

**june 21**  
3 hrs of trying to make sure my frame doesn’t collapse like my motivation  
reinforcements = half-cooked  
figured out where PSU can sit without frying everything  
probably fine. idk. future me will scream

---

**june 22**  
5 hrs trying to finalize BOM. tabs kept multiplying like rabbits  
found a decent extruder  
also found a meme that sent me  
productivity = 51% memes, 49% panic
