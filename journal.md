**June 15**  
2 hours just sketching dumb ideas on paper  
thought i was designing a spaceship but it’s just a rectangle with motors  
also made a folder called “cool printer stuff” feeling organized af

**June 16**  
spent like 3 hours on fusion 360 making the frame model  
forgot how constraints work halfway through  
dimensioned the whole steel frame, it actually looks real now  
started feeling like i could build NASA rockets next

**June 17**  
1 hour deep dive on linear rails  
THK? HIWIN? clone? idk anymore bro  
settled on THK rails cos they sound elite  
also read 2 reddit threads and now i have trust issues

**June 18**  
2.5 hours scrolling through shopee + random sites  
added like 20 tabs of extruders, hotends, fans, more fans, fans for the fans  
accidentally almost bought an aquarium filter. focus = zero.  
finally started making the BOM tho

**June 19**  
measurements day. 1.5 hours of me with a tape measure and a calculator  
measuring the steel frame tubes, checking what length i can get from local shops  
also looked at aluminum profiles like i have aluminum money (i don’t)  
final measurements = chef’s kiss

frame reinforcement planning for 1 hour

also figured out where to mount the PSU. progress.

**June 22**
